The Project is a content based movies recommender system. 
There are 2 ipynb files:

1) Movie_Recommender_System.ipynb: This has all the manipulation and engineering the data needed. All necessary steps for pre processing are done.
				Two .csv files were imported and merged to get the  required details.
				

2) Streamlit_app.ipynb: here a small code using streamlit is written to give it a UI where the user can search or select a movie from drop down menu and click 			on the recommend button. the recommendations will be displayed
